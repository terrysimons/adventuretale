## Development

It's recommended to use pyenv or a venv for development.

To set up a local development environment:

### Linux/macOS Virtual Environment

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/scripts/activate
```

### Windows Virtual Environment

```
python3 -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/activate
```

### Install Development Package

Once you have an environment created, link the local source tree with pip.

```
pip install -e .
```
