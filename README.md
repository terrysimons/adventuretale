## Development

It's recommended to use a venv for development.

To set up a local development environment:

### Linux/macOS Virtual Environment

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/scripts/activate
```

### Windows Virtual Environment

```
python3 -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/activate
```

Once you have an environment created, link the local source tree with pip.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
